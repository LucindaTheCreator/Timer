Permanent data is being handled in two files; runhash.dat and UserData.db

1. runhash.dat contains global non-user data about the app and global parameters
   - the data batches are separated by "," character and a single data batch consists of 3 identifiers:
        key:data_type:value
        -key is the string name by which the value can be referenced after unpacking
        -data_type is the specifier for the type of data that the container contains - it is automatically assigned!
        -value is the value of the data batch
   - by default the data batch contains only one item -- (bool) first_run, which specified if the app is run for the
   first time.
   -data from runhash.dat can be formatted and deformatted by using the Hashtools module
2. Userdata.db
   - Database containing many tables (tables are autogenerated upon new user being added)
       - All_tables: table containing list of all the present tables and their columns
       - Users: table containing list of users with values: (str) name,(str) surname, (str) email, (int) age_group,
         (int) user_identifier
       Autogenerated tables (for each user):
       - (Name)_(Surname)_Events: table containing event data for the specific user:
            (str) event_name: name of the event
            (str) event_desc: description of the event
            (str:yy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss) start_time: start time of event
            (str:yy:mm:dd:hh:mm:ss) end_time: end time of event
            (int) event_score: TO BE IMPL YET
            (int) event_priority: events with highest priority shown first
            (long_int) EID: unique identifier of the event
       - (Name)_(Surname)_Functionality:
            (json) projects: contains list of larger projects
            (json) goals: contains a list of major goals
            (json) personalization temp: contains json of templates (max 3) which are shown on start screen
            (str) misc: everything not specified up to this point
